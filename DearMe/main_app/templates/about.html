    <h1>About DearMe</h1>

    <p>
        Time moves forward, and we cannot go back. But memories and messages can travel to the future. 
        <strong>DearMe</strong> is a bridge between today and tomorrow, letting you send letters and share moments with your future self or loved ones.
    </p>

    <p>
        A note of encouragement, a heartfelt message, or a memory to revisit — DearMe keeps your emotions alive, 
        reaching across time to touch hearts, including your own in the years to come.
    </p>

    <p>
        Use the <em>Sad Button</em> for comfort, write daily diary entries, or create memories to open later. 
        Each message is a whisper of love, hope, and connection, waiting for the right moment.
    </p>

    <p>
        Even across the distance of years, you are never truly alone. Your feelings, thoughts, and love endure, 
        reaching forward to bring comfort, joy, and reflection.
    </p>
